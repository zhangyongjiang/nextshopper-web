                        The “Terms of Service” set forth herein constitutes the legally binding agreement (“Agreement’) between you (the “merchant”, “seller” or “you”) and Nextshopper, Inc. ("Nextshopper", "Nextshopper.com", "we", "us", "our"), regarding your use of and access to www.Nextshopper.com and any other websites owned or operated by Nextshopper or its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Website”), our mobile app “Nextshopper” (hereinafter referred to as the “App”), and any resources, features, functionality, or services made available through the Website or the App (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using the Website in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all merchants of the Site, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants and contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4 class="text-black font-bold m-b m-t">1. Nextshopper is a Platform</h4>
                    <p>
                        Nextshopper is an online platform providing information exchange which enables merchants to offer and sell goods to buyers on the Website, the App, or via Services. As a platform, Nextshopper is not directly involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. Nextshopper does not prescreen users or the content or information provided by users. Nextshopper cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction and has no control over the accuracy, quality, safety, morality, legality or truthfulness of the listed items and their descriptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an online platform where users can freely post information, Nextshopper cannot prescreen contents posted on the Website or the App and is therefore not responsible or liable for such content including, but not limited to, data, text, items, profiles, information, images, audio, video and external links posted by you, other merchants, or outside parties on Nextshopper. As these contents can be potentially harmful, you acknowledge that you are using the Nextshopper service at your own risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legal title of the goods being sold passes directly from the seller to the buyer upon completion of the transaction. At no time during the transaction will Nextshopper hold the legal title, possession, or constructive possession of the goods being sold, nor will Nextshopper serve as a bailee, an intermediary or a middleman of passing the title or possession of the goods being sold during the transaction. Therefore, Nextshopper is in no position and has no legal authority to transfer legal title of the items being sold from the seller to the buyer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nextshopper cannot verify and thus cannot guarantee the accuracy and the truthfulness of the identity, age, and nationality of a merchant or buyer. You are advised to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Website and use your own wisdom and due diligence to verify the identity, trustworthiness and creditworthiness of these partners, for example, by using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        NextShopper does not charge merchant fees for becoming a merchant, setting up merchant’s online shops, or listing items for sale. When a listed item is sold, NextShopper will charges commission fee based on a percentage of sale price or a set amount per each transaction. You are responsible for paying all the fees and applicable taxes associated with using and selling on Nextshopper. In certain situations, including but not limited to, a void or invalid transaction, Nextshopper may issue credit of the applicable fees to a merchant account. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Fee Calculation:</strong>
                    <p>
                        After a transaction is complete, Nextshopper will pay merchants in the amount of Total Sales minus Commission Fee. “Total Sales” is calculated as the sum of the sales price and shipping cost. “Commission Fee” is calculated either as a percentage of Total Cost, or as a predetermined set amount per each transaction. When merchants list items for sale, they will be afford an opportunity to review and accept the fees charged and decide whether they would like the listings to be automatically renewed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nextshopper reserves the right to adjust the prices or shipping costs displayed to users in order to boost or optimize the sales of items for our merchants. However, this adjustment in price and shipping cost will not affect the percentage or the set amount that Nextshopper has previously agreed to charge the merchants for their orders. 
                    </p>
                    <strong>Payment Method:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Nextshopper uses Braintree Payment Solutions LLC (Braintree) for payment processing.

                    <p>
                        A merchant's shipped transactions may be eligible for payment within 30 days of the shipment date. Transactions that cannot be confirmed as shipped may be ineligible for payment. Nextshopper will pay merchants for their eligible transactions on a monthly basis. This payment will be the net amount, which is calculated as the merchant's prices (product and shipping) less our charge, pursuant to the merchant’s revenue sharing or cost agreement with Nextshopper. 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <h4 class="text-black font-bold m-b m-t">4. Listing and Selling</h4>
                    <strong>Listing: </strong>
                    <p>
                        All listings on Nextshopper must be goods for sale. You are required to list prices and shipping costs for each listed item. By listing an item on the Website or the App you warrant that the listing and all aspects of the item listed comply with Nextshopper's published policies. You also warrant that you hold the legal title of the listed item and that you have the authority to legally sell the item and pass the title onto the buyer. You must accurately, completely and conspicuously describe your listing item and all the terms and conditions of sale including refund policy in your Nextshopper shop. All items must be listed in an appropriate category. If the quantity of the listed item is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing. Your listing may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other contents reasonably relevant to the sale of that item. You cannot misrepresent the item's location or use another merchant's account without permission.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Selling: </strong>

                        All listing prices are final. Seller may not alter the item's listing price after the sale for the purpose of avoiding Nextshopper’s transaction fees. On top of item’s listing price, seller may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items to the buyer.
                    </p>
