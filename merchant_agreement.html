<strong>Notice and Takedown Procedure</strong>
<p>It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). This section describes the information that should be present in these notices. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov, but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p>It is expected that all users of any part of the Site will comply with applicable copyright laws. If Nextshopper receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating user Account(s), regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If we remove or disable access to the Site in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>
<strong>Infringement Notification</strong>
<p>If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please contact nextshopper with information in a written communication (preferably via email):</p>
<p>1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</p>
<p>2. Identification of the material on the Site that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Nextshopper to locate the material;</p>
<p>3. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Nextshopper to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</p>
<p>4. The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";</p>
<p>5. The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate, and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed"; and</p>
<p>6. A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>
<strong>Counter Notification</strong>
<p>A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide Nextshopper's Designated Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication (preferably via email):</p>

<p>6. Your signature, in physical or electronic form.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of such counter notification, Nextshopper will promptly provide the person who provided the original infringement notification with a copy of the counter notification, and inform that person that Nextshopper will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. Nextshopper will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.</p>

<p>In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Nextshopper will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</p>
